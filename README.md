 Project Status: [Completed]
# Project Intro/Objective

I have been tasked with assisting Microsoft in their venture into the movie industry. My goal was to explore what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office and to provide these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives. My analysis of the movie industry, achieved by garnering data and utilizing descriptive statistics and visualizations, has shown that a larger budget is correlated with a higher worldwide box office gross. Microsoft can use this report to target their production budget, genre and release-time of their upcoming movie endeavors to generate the highest amount of revenue possible.
