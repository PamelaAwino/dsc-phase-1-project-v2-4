 Project Status: [Completed]
# Project Intro/Objective

I have been tasked with assisting Microsoft in their venture into the movie industry. My goal was to explore what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office and to provide these findings to Microsoft's new movie studio executives. My analysis of the movie industry, achieved by garnering data and utilizing descriptive statistics and visualizations, has shown that a larger budget is correlated with a higher worldwide box office gross. Microsoft can use this report to target their production budget, genre and release-time of their upcoming movie endeavors to generate the highest amount of revenue possible.

# Project Description

First, I dived into asking questions for decision making regarding opening a new movie studio.
Considering the best vote average values, which genres are good to invest, and which languages also?
Considering the best profit, which genres are good to invest and also what is the percantage of top 5 genres?
Choosing a right release time-Which month of the year is best for highest revenue and when films are commonly released?
Investment into foreign releases and foreign marketing?
To find answers to these questions, I collected data from three different sources. Firstly, from www.themoviedb.org we grabbed two data sets. First one is for best 20 revenue films according to years. Second one is for best rated 1500 films. The websites has the data related to movies and we used API methodology to extract the data needed for our analysis. The genre codes and their respective words are also grabbed from the same website.

Secondly, with web scraping using BeautifulSoup we grabbed budget and revenues for movies. To do this, we used the-numbers.com website and Boxofficemojo.com. Then, we merged them and clean them for useful format. And, plot our results for every question to see them obviously.

# Recommendations

I would recoomend Microsoft campany to produce the following movies which generated the highest revenues both worldwide and domestically:

    > Avater 

    > Star Wars Ep. VII: The force Awakens
